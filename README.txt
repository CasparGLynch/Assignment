*****Description*****
This is my fullstack assignment for Flora Logistics. I created an API using the django rest framework and a frontend application using react,
typescript and redux. The communication between the API and the react App are done in JSON messages. My App is called marketplace which is designed sells fruits on the internet. 
I have already populated the database with some products and have also created 3 orders which can be seen on the website and backend. 
The API is completly open, meaning anyone can modify the database. I decided to leave it as such for demonstation purposes.
